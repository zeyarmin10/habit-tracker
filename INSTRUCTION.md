2. Perform a Deep Clean and Reinstall ðŸ§¹
   After verifying babel.config.js, you need to aggressively clear all caches and reinstall dependencies to ensure everything is fresh.

Action: Follow these steps precisely in your terminal:

Stop your Expo development server: Press Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C on Mac) in your terminal until the server completely stops.

Delete node_modules and lock files:

Bash

rm -r -force node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json yarn.lock
(Use del /s /q node_modules and del package-lock.json yarn.lock on Windows if rm doesn't work.)

Clear Expo's cache:

Bash

npx expo r -c

# or

npx expo start --clear
This command clears Expo's specific bundler cache.

Reinstall dependencies:

Bash

npm install

# or if you use yarn:

# yarn install

Start your Expo project again:

Bash

npx expo start --clear
Using --clear again here is a good safety measure.

If using Expo Go on a device/emulator:

Android: Clear the app's data for Expo Go (Settings -> Apps -> Expo Go -> Storage -> Clear Data/Cache).

iOS: Uninstall and reinstall the Expo Go app.
This ensures no old cached bundles are causing issues.
